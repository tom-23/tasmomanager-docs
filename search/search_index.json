Since one of the main goals of this project was to make it beginner-friendly, I've created a windows installer and macOS .dmg for easy installation. macOS On macOS, simply download the .dmg release file, open it up and click and drag the app package into the Applications directory. When opening the app from the launchpad, you may encounter a pop-up, preventing you from opening TasmoManager. To work around this, right-click and open the app from the Applications directory. You can also download the .pkg file and follow the on screen instructions when installing. Be sure to right-click and open the pkg otherwise you won't get an option allowing you to open the file Windows Download the installer executable and run. Windows might pop up a smart screen message (in the process of getting that removed), if so just click on More Info > Allow. Then, follow the on-screen instructions. Updating You can update TasmoManager the same way in macOS or Windows. Firstly, head over to the app's preferences and click on \"Software Update\". Next, select the update channel you would like to receive updates from (default is \"Stable\"). If there is a new update to be installed, a green \"Begin Software Update\" button should appear. Once pressed, TasmoManager will download the update and begin installing it onto your system. Please ensure you enter your administrator password when you are presented to do so otherwise the update process will not begin. (This only applies to TasmoManager v1.0.0-alpha.5 and above).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation","text":"Thanks for downloading TasmoManager!

No devices show up Ensure that you have the following: Tasmota version that supports device discovery Make sure that the tasmota version installed on your devices includes the new home assistant discovery protocol. If you have tasmota-lite installed, you will NOT have home assistant discovery compiled by default. SetOption19 set to 0 Have SetOption19 set to 0 to ensure the new home assistant discovery protocol is used. You can change this in the WebUI by opening up the console and entering SetOption19 0 . The device should start to appear in the device list after a few seconds. MQTT Server which prevents read / write access TasmoManager needs to read data from the tasmota/discovery . Make sure you are able to Read/Write data using an MQTT client such as MQTTExplorer. Make sure your MQTT server isn't sonoff-adapter (for iobroker) as it doesn't allow for client read access. tasmota/discovery topic deleted The tasmota discovery topic could have been deleted. This can easily be fixed by restarting the devices connected to the MQTT server. Old devices still exist This is caused by the device's discovery topic still being retained on the MQTT server. You can either delete the topic from the server using an MQTT client or hide offline devices in TasmoManager (Settings > General > Show Offline Devices).","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"If you have any issues whilst using TasmoManager, please look at this page before submitting a github issue.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#no-devices-show-up","text":"Ensure that you have the following: Tasmota version that supports device discovery Make sure that the tasmota version installed on your devices includes the new home assistant discovery protocol.
